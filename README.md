# Domain-Driven Design: Aggregates

Aggregates are a key building block in Domain-Driven Design (DDD). They represent a cluster of domain objects that are treated as a single unit for data changes, ensuring consistency and enforcing business rules within their boundaries. This document explains what aggregates are, their structure, and best practices for using them effectively.

## Purpose of Aggregates

Aggregates serve two main purposes:

1. **Consistency Boundary**:
    - Aggregates define the boundary within which all changes must remain consistent.
    - They ensure that business rules (invariants) are enforced during transactions.

2. **Transactional Scope**:
    - All changes to the objects within an aggregate are committed together in a single transaction.
    - This prevents partial updates that could leave the system in an invalid state.

## Structure of Aggregates

### 1. **Aggregate Root**
The root entity acts as the entry point for accessing and modifying the aggregate. It controls access to other objects within the aggregate.

### 2. **Child Entities**
These are other entities or value objects that belong to the aggregate but are managed by the aggregate root. They cannot exist independently outside of the aggregate.

### Example: "Order" Aggregate
- **Aggregate Root**: `Order`
    - Fields: `OrderId`, `CustomerId`, `OrderStatus`
    - Methods: `addItem(OrderItem item)`, `removeItem(OrderItem item)`, `completeOrder()`
- **Child Entities**: `OrderItem`
    - Fields: `ProductId`, `Quantity`, `Price`

#### Business Rules:
- An order cannot be completed if it has no items.
- The total price of the order must match the sum of the item prices.

## Characteristics of Aggregates

1. **Encapsulation**:
    - Only the aggregate root is accessible from outside the aggregate. All external interactions go through the root.

2. **Business Rules**:
    - The aggregate ensures that all business rules and invariants are maintained within its boundary.

3. **Small and Focused**:
    - Aggregates should be kept relatively small to reduce complexity and avoid performance issues in distributed systems.

4. **Transaction Management**:
    - Aggregates ensure transactional integrity by committing all changes within their boundary together.

## Best Practices

1. **Define Clear Boundaries**:
    - Focus on transactional consistency and enforce business rules within the aggregate.

2. **Use the Aggregate Root**:
    - All external interactions should go through the root entity to maintain encapsulation.

3. **Minimize Relationships Between Aggregates**:
    - Use identifiers (e.g., `OrderId`) to reference other aggregates instead of direct relationships.

4. **Eventual Consistency for Cross-Aggregate Interactions**:
    - Use domain events to communicate changes between aggregates to avoid coupling and maintain scalability.

## Working with Aggregates

### Example Interaction:
1. A **Command**, such as `AddItemToOrder`, interacts with the `Order` aggregate root.
2. The root validates the addition and updates its state while enforcing business rules.
3. If significant changes occur, the aggregate can publish **Domain Events** (e.g., `OrderCompleted`) to notify other parts of the system.

### Scenarios Where Aggregates Shine:
- **E-commerce**:
    - The `Order` aggregate manages `OrderItem`s to ensure correct pricing and consistency of item quantities.
- **Inventory Management**:
    - A `Warehouse` aggregate manages `InventoryItem`s to enforce stock level rules.

## Key Takeaways

- Aggregates enforce consistency and encapsulate business rules within their boundaries.
- Use the aggregate root as the only entry point for interactions.
- Design aggregates to be small and focused for better performance and scalability.
- Use domain events for communication between aggregates to achieve eventual consistency.

By following these guidelines, you can build scalable, maintainable systems that reflect the complexity of your business domain.
